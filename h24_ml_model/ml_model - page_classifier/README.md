# Training Data Overview for Page Classifier Model

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of the dataset used for training the Page Classifier Model, which aims to distinguish between different types of pages in medical records, particularly focusing on identifying "Presentism" pages from other types such as "Daily Evolution" and "Vital Signs" (in some cases).

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about the files selected for training the page classifier model. Here are some key insights:

- **File Categories and Distribution**: The files are categorized into various medical departments or specialties, such as CPAL, CUI, ECG, ENF, FONO, KINE, MED, PEDIA, PSICO, PSIQ, and T.O. Each category has a different number of files, ranging from a few files to hundreds or even thousands.
  
- **Number of Pages per File**: The number of pages varies significantly across different files within each category. Some files contain only one page, while others may have several pages, with the maximum number of pages reaching up to thousands.

- **Training Dataset Size**: The dataset comprises a total of X files across all categories, with a total of Y pages. This dataset size provides a diverse range of examples for training the page classifier model, enabling it to learn and generalize patterns effectively.
