# Technical Document: Layer 1: Segmentation Based on Service Provided

## Introduction

The data preparation process, crucial for training the HOUSE24 document classification Machine Learning model, is approached through a methodology structured in three layers. The purpose is to refine and optimize the dataset to align them with GCP Document AI Services standards and requirements.

# Preprocessing of PDF Files for the HOUSE24 Classification Model

## Introduction

This README outlines the preprocessing steps undertaken for training the HOUSE24 document classification model. The preprocessing methodology is structured in multiple layers to refine and optimize the dataset, aligning it with the standards and requirements of Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Document AI Services.


### Process Details:

In the initial layer, extensive checks and filters were applied using Jupyter Python to classify documents effectively. The process involved analyzing the contents of each folder, focusing on the information related to the services provided and the various forms in which data was received.

### Content Composition:

The contents of each folder provided insights into the composition of data received for different services. This included the number of pages comprising each document and the distribution of documents based on page count.

### Objective:

The primary objective of this layer was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's operations and service offerings. By delving into the composition of data and the structure of documents, the aim was to identify the most suitable approach and technology for addressing the classification challenge effectively.

### Insights:

Through this detailed analysis, valuable insights were gained into the company's workflow, enabling informed decision-making regarding the selection of appropriate technologies and methodologies for document classification.

## Conclusion

The preprocessing process ensures that the dataset is optimized and ready for training the HOUSE24 classification model. By adhering to GCP standards and leveraging insights from the initial segmentation layer, the model training process is streamlined, leading to more accurate classification results.
